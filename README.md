This assignment was one of our first projects where we wrote custom logic. Even though the app is basic compared to the things I have developed since then, I am incredibly proud of this application, as it broke the ground on diving deep into using JS and jQuery to customize applications in a way I had never written.
The application allows you to go through a quiz with a theme from the movie The Dark Knight. In the application, you take a quiz with a timer, and subtle background music playing. Before this application, the applications we created were incredibly basic, with almost no styling. This was the first assignment where I was excited to spend hours customizing.
